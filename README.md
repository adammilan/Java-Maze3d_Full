# Maze3d_Full
Maze3d Development in Java, MVP (Model view Presenter) platform

Algorithms search in the maze: BFS/DFS (for short ways in the maze).

Algorithm for building the Maze3d: Growing Tree Algorithm (http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/27/maze-generation-growing-tree-algorithm) /OR SimpleMaze3dGenerator (Algorithm i build based on the TreeGeneratorAlgorithm with minor changes)

IDE:eclipse

* ###### If your too lazy to run the Full project, you can Download the Compile File attaching in this reposities called "compile maze3d" (its basiclay same files but as jar files) and then hit Run.bat button.
